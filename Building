JUPYTER

1. Jupyterlabs JupyterLite 
Any new coding #students / junior #datascientists etc looking for a quick start to creating 
Jupyter notebooks (which let you present code and run it and see the visualisations/outputs all 
neatly in one flowing document) can get started without the need for installations etc using Jupyterlabs JupyterLite
- letting you create and run the notebooks directly in your browser (The Jupyter system supports 
over 100 programming languages.) Give it a try - 
it's a great way to get a tool/ bit of analysis running and present what is does effectively!
