I have found the useful below and included a bit of a note with each recommendation:


1. The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People
https://www.franklincovey.com/the-7-habits/
My Notes: 
Feb 2023  - Over the past few years ive tried to work through this book quickly and got nowhere fast but I finally realised at H2 of
last year that I needed to master habit 1 before moving onto the next chapter - 
Habit 1 - Be proactive. 
THIS HAS HELPED ME IMMENSELY!! - once i decided to simply master habit 1 and focus slowly working on 
the details of what is explained about being Pproactive over reactive, using my initiative and 
resources and realising the past is out of my control I actually started
taking responsibility for my actions and goals and making progress.
Even if you just read and apply chapter 1 I cannot recommend this enough!
